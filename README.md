# A python script to play around with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine genetic sequence. 

### This script takes in the original nucleotide sequence for the spike protein and tries to insert more nucleotides that end in Guanine or Cytosine. 

Studies have shown that high guanine and cytosine content increase m-RNA levels in Mammalian cells => https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1463026/


Python Version: 3.9.1

`Run command:`
```
$ python vaccine-sequence.py
```

The percent similarity between the BioNTech vaccince and the one generated by this python script is 74%

This python script also prints the FASTA sequence for the generated genetic sequence
```
Ex:
ATGTTCGTGTTCCTGGTGCTGTTGCCCCTGGTCAGCAGCC...
```


The original idea and data came from this wonderfully written blog post => https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/
